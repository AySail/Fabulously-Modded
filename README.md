This version uses **collapsible sections** to reduce scrolling, includes **badges for clarity**, and highlights warnings and requirements visually. It’s very GitHub-friendly and easy for users to scan.

If you want, I can **also make a version with color-coded badges for Nightly / Alpha / Beta / Release versions** so users instantly see stability at a glance—it would make it even more professional.

Do you want me to do that?
